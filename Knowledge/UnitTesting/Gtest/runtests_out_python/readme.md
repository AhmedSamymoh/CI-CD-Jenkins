# Project Overview

# Python Script (search.py): 

This script searches for a specific word ('FAILED') in a text file (save.txt) and exits with a status code based on whether the word is found.
# Google Test Results: 

A set of Google Test unit tests for a C++ project, which checks specific functionalities and reports the results.
#Python Script: search.py
