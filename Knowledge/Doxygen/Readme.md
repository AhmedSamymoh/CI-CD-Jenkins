# Setup Doxygen
**If you're on Windows**, You have to install both (Doxygen)[http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html] and (Graphviz)[http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php] , or 
**if you're on Linux** and have used `apt-get install doxygen graphviz`

#### Make sure to :
Add the bin directory of graphviz and Doxygen to your windows path variable (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin)

### Configurations : 
Use the configurations I have done in the doxyfile to generate the UMLS
